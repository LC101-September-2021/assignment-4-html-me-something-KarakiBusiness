               <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">Hello fellow viewers. This is Mohamed-Ali's webpage. Built and designed by yours truly. Attached is a little story on how this came to be. </p>
               <p>Learning the news and paying attention to my surroundings gave me the intuition to look into such a field. The software industry is huge and highly in demand. This was not of any of my concerns when I was on the road to becoming an Electrical Engineer. I was on the path to the basic achievements of every college student, this was my main concern. I had no idea why I was following the basics of planned careers.  </p>
               <p>It all started with an email from Launch Code. “Please take this math test to see if you qualify for a certification process”. “Of course, this is not the legitimate shortcut to achieving what one works for.” I thought to myself. This was the turning point of my confidence to pursue and achieve a skillset that I need to support myself financially as well as academically. I studied the dilemma handed to me, only to see the blessings behind it. </p>
               <p>As I completed the basic prerequisites directed to me. I look into web development more and more. This is what is written for me and I am destined to succeeding in software development. I have a brother who is in this field. He as well did not graduate from college for the cons it holds. If he can do it, I know I should be able to. Well, Thanks for visiting. I hope to impress you more in future successes! </p>
